# SoundPic
SoundPic was a software development project during my fifth semester at the university. In total we were seven people with from different university programmes and with different skills. I was responsible for front-end web development, prototyping and testing. I worked very close to our backend developer who also happened to be our team leader.

SoundPic was an application similar to Instagram for Android with a website. The different was that users could also record sound together with the image. That way people at e.g. concerts could upload images giving their followers a more "live" feeling.

## How we did it
Like mentioned above we were seven people working on two projects in one (the Android application and the website). What differentiated us from the other groups were that we decided for making two products instead of only one. We did that even though we were lacking three people (all other groups were 10 people). This was a challenge, but thanks to a good group we managed to finish both products in time, both connected to the same back-end and database. We made it thanks to regularly scheduled SCRUM meetings, section meetings and some fighting spirit.
## Technology
The front-end of the website was created with JSP, HTML5 and CSS. The back-end (which is not included in this repository) was created with Java, Spring, Hibernate and SQL on a LAMP server.

## What's here
I've only included my parts of the project in this repository which means the Android application and the back-end is missing.
